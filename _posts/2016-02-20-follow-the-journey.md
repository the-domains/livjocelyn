[SHARING THE JOURNEY ][2]OF AN ULTIMATE QUEST: MAKING SENSE OF THE WORLD AND OUR PLACE IN IT

I believe in Remembering the Spirit of our
interconnection of nature, where we have come from.  I believe in Igniting
the Flame of innovation for who we can become by using our technologies and
capabilities.

It is time for an
educational platform that unifies the human spirit and our inherent capacities
to Dream This World into Being.
