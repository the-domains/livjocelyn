Jocelyn Anna Lernout

When I
began my venture to build a foundation and production company, I felt like I
was on a majical journey.

It began with
a vision of making films with music to share a message in an artistic and
powerful way.

Once realizing film would
be in my life, I bought a camera and started capturing events.

After just completing university, I decided
to contact my old highschool to see if I could work creatively with my
ideas.

To my delight, they allowed me to
work in the communications lab, participating at my own pace.

I made a business card, posters of my ideas,
a t-shirt design, logos and my first film.

Ironically enough, I was provided with an opportunity to apply to a
contest, what the future of education would look like.

Titled, 'Education of 2020', I explored my
ideas while filming inspiring places around the highschool.

Once the film was complete, I decided to
share the project with classrooms and asked for feedback on what the students
felt the future of education should be. 

It was amazing to be
inspired by a contest to build a vision for my company.

Today, I am re-inspired and invigorated at
being in a renewed time, ready to make my vision reality.
