When I began my venture to build a foundation and production company, I felt like I was on a majical journey.

It began with a vision of making films with music to share a message in an artistic and powerful way. (Mind you, my journey originated while studying University, where I began to think and write my thoughts, being honest with wanting to understand the world, and therefore, I feel I ignited something, co-created a moment that helped spark my journey. That's why I believe in intentions and 'embracing' a moment to be honest with who you want to be, and believing that you can co-create the life you want to live. Be empowered to pursue your dreams and think about who you want to be. 

Once realizing film would be in my life, I bought a camera and started capturing events.

After just completing university, I decided to contact my old highschool to see if I could work creatively with my ideas.

To my delight, they allowed me to work in the communications lab, participating at my own pace.

I made a business card, posters of my ideas, a t-shirt design, logos and my first film.

Ironically enough, I was provided with an opportunity to apply to a contest, what the future of education would look like.

Titled, 'Education of 2020', I explored my ideas while filming inspiring places around the highschool.

Once the film was complete, I decided to share the project with classrooms and asked for feedback on what the students felt the future of education should be. 

It was amazing to be inspired by a contest to build a vision for my company.

Today, I am re-inspired and invigorated at being in a renewed time, ready to make my vision reality.

I am embracing my ultimate dream to be in movies, make movies, build a foundation and travel the world sharing cultural awareness and insight into our capabilities to live our dream and our lives, empowered.

Through the years, the vision has continued to develop. Today, I am so happy I get to share my journey with you, by sharing my life experience, research and art in new and innovative ways. 

My mission is to ignite, inspire, empower and motivate.

Welcome to THROUGH AN EYE TO THE WORLD. I am happy to be here, with you on this adventure and divine existence. Much Love Always, Jocelyn Anna L\*
